    <p>
    DND 5e characters have 6 Ability scores: <br>
    Strength (STR), Dexterity (DEX), Constitution (CON), Intelligence (INT), Wisdom (WIS) and Charisma (CHA).
    When making a spellcaster, follow these steps:<br>
    1) If you are rolling for ability scores, place your highest score into your Spellcasting ability.<br>
    2) Place your second highest into Consitution. This will increase your health points, meaning you can take more damage.<br>
    3) Place your third and highest into Dexterity. This will increase your Armor Class (AC), meaning you will get hit less.<br>
    It also helps you aim better with ranged weapons (ie Bows and Slings) or weapons with Finesse (like Daggers and Rapiers)!<br>
    4) Place your lowest score into Strength. Strength determines how much you can carry and how well you attack with melee weapons,<br>
        but you should be relying on spells anyway.<br>
    5) Place your other scores as you see fit.
    <br>
    <br>
    This should be a good balance of your capabilities - you will be better with certain actions that others, but don't be afraid to experiment!
