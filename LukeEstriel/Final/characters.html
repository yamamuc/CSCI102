    <p>Assuming you want to play a caster, just pick one at random, right?</p>
    <h1>Ohoho! What a fool you are!</h1>
    <p>Yes, there are many classes, and each has different roles, in and out of combat.<br>
    We will focus on three classes for proof of concept: Cleric, Sorcerer, and Wizard.<br>
    Here is a generic table showcasing their basic capabilities.</p>
    <table>
        <tr>
            <th>Class Name</th>
            <th>Defensive Capacity</th>
            <th>Offensive Capacity</th>
            <th>Healing Capacity</th> 
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Cleric</td>
            <td>Average</td>
            <td>Weak</td>
            <td>Strong</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Sorcerer</td>
            <td>Average</td>
            <td>Strong</td>
            <td>Weak</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Wizard</td>
            <td>Strong</td>
            <td>Average</td>
            <td>Weak</td>
        </tr>
    </table>
    
    <p>This isn't a perfect representation, but hopefully you get the gist.</p>
    <p>The important thing to consider foremost is "what do I want to be able to do?" If you enjoy playing healers in other games, <br>
    consider playing the Cleric. If you're one for combos and strategizing, the Sorcerer is a perfect pick. If you enjoy playing blue <br>
    decks in Magic the Gathering, the Wizard might be for you.
    </p>
    <h1>As well, these three rely one different Abilities to cast their magic.</h1>
    <p> 
    Clerics rely on Wisdom, often associated with Senses and "Street Smarts".<br>
    Sorcerers rely on Charisma, often associated with Demeanor and Charm (the social kind).<br>
    Wizards rely on Intelligence, often associated with Memory and "Book Smarts".
    </p>
    <h1>Do consider picking a caster that suits your personal strengths. It can be easier to understand the character this way.</h1>
