        Babel's List of "How to stay Alive":<br>
        1) Violence isn't alway the answer! Try to see if the creatures before want to negotiate.<br>
        2) Stay away from monsters! You are most vulnerable in short-range combat.<br>
        3) Reserve your spell slots! Try to use only what you need, UNLESS a person is unconscious.<br>
        4) If a person is unconscious, disregard rule 2 and help them as quickly as possible.<br>
        Casting Healing Word is the best option if you're a Cleric.
        5) Use the environment to your advantage! Traps, pits, and other dangers can be used against your enemies!
